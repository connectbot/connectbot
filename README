Compiling
---------

To compile ConnectBot using Ant, you must specify where your Android SDK is via the local.properties file. Insert a line similar to the following with the full path to your SDK:

sdk-location=/usr/local/android


Localization
------------

To use only a specific localization or localizations in your ConnectBot build using Ant, simply insert lines into default.properties similar to these:

apk-configurations=english,europe,asia
apk-config-english=en
apk-config-europe=en,fr,it,de,es
apk-config-asia=en,zh_CN

You may also configure this via Eclipse via Project Properties -> Android -> Project APK Configurations


ProGuard Support
----------------

Download the ProGuard distribution from its website at http://proguard.sourceforge.net/ and place the proguard.jar into the "tools" subdirectory in the ConnectBot root directory.

When running ant to build ConnectBot and engage ProGuard, use:

ant proguard release
